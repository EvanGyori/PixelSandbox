A pixel simulation sandbox that uses SDL for drawing.
use WASD for camera movement
use the scroll wheel for zooming in and out
as of now, you can't place or remove pixels

debug file launches the program in linux

The code isnt laggy, the refresh rate is just set to
low currently so the sand can be seen falling
